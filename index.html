            <p>In computer programming, an <span class="fragment highlight-blue">application programming interface (API)</span> is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. </p>

            <h3>Use <span class="fragment highlight-blue">HTTP verbs</span> to operate on the collections and elements.</h3>

Think of them as mapping to the acronym, <span class="fragment highlight-blue">CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete)</span>.</p>

            <p>The point is that developers probably don't need the chart to understand how the API behaves. They can experiment with and learn the API without the documentation.</p>

            <h3>Plural nouns and concrete names</h3>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Should you choose <span class="fragment highlight-blue">singular</span> or <span class="fragment highlight-blue">plural</span> nouns for your resource names? You'll see popular APIs use both. Let's look at a few examples:</p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Foursquare</th>
                  <th>GroupOn</th>
                  <th>Zappos</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>/checkins</td>
                  <td>/deals</td>
                  <td>/Product</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Given that the first thing most people probably do with a RESTful API is a GET, we think it reads more easily and is more intuitive to use plural nouns. But above all, avoid a mixed model in which you use singular for some resources, plural for others. Being consistent allows developers to predict and guess the method calls as they learn to work with your API.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Concrete names are better than abstract</h3>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Achieving pure abstraction is sometimes a goal of API architects. However, that abstraction is not always meaningful for developers.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Take for example an API that accesses content in various forms - blogs, videos, news articles, and so on.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>An API that models everything at the highest level of abstraction - as <span class="fragment highlight-blue">/items</span> or <span class="fragment highlight-blue">/assets</span> in our example - loses the opportunity to paint a tangible picture for developers to know what they can do with this API. It is more compelling and useful to see the resources listed as blogs, videos, and news articles.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>The level of abstraction depends on your scenario. You also want to expose a manageable number of resources. Aim for concrete naming and to keep the number of resources between 12 and 24.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>In summary, an intuitive API uses <span class="fragment highlight-blue">plural rather than singular nouns</span>, and <span class="fragment highlight-blue">concrete rather than abstract names</span>.</p>

            <p>Let's look again at the API we modeled in nouns are good, verbs are bad - the API that interacts with our dogs resource. </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>We're using HTTP verbs to operate on the resources and collections. Our dogs belong to owners. To get all the dogs belonging to a specific owner, or to create a new dog for that owner, do a GET or a POST:</p>

            <table>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>GET</td>
                  <td>/owners/5678/dogs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>POST</td>
                  <td>/owners/5678/dogs</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Now, the relationships can be complex. Owners have relationships with veterinarians, who have relationships with dogs, who have relationships with food, and so on. </p>
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>It's not uncommon to see people string these together making a URL 5 or 6 levels deep. Remember that once you have the primary key for one level, you usually don't need to include the levels above because you've already got your specific object.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>In other words, you shouldn't need too many cases where a URL is deeper</p>

            <small>/resource/identifier/resource</small>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>As much as possible max of 2nd level</p>
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Sweep complexity behind the ‘?’</h3>

            <p>Most APIs have intricacies beyond the base level of a resource. Complexities can include many states that can be updated, changed, queried, as well as the attributes associated with a resource.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Make it simple for developers to use the base URL by putting optional states and attributes behind the HTTP question mark. To get all red dogs running in the park:</p>
            <small>GET /dogs?color=red&state=running&location=park</small>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>In summary, keep your API intuitive by simplifying the associations between resources, and sweeping parameters and other complexities under the rug of the HTTP question mark.</p>

            <h3>Facebook</h3>
            <p>No matter what happens on a Facebook request, you get back the 200-status code - everything is OK. Many error messages also push down into the HTTP response. Here they also throw an #803 error but with no information about what #803 is or how to react to it.</p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <p>There are really only 3 outcomes in the interaction between an app and an API:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Everything worked - success</li>
              <li>The application did something wrong – client error</li>
              <li>The API did something wrong – server error</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>We can start by using the following 3 codes. If you need more, add them. But we shouldn't need to go beyond 8.</p>

            <ul>

            <p>Twilio uses a timestamp in the URL (note the European format).</p>

            <p>At compilation time, the developer includes the timestamp of the application when the code was compiled. That timestamp goes in all the HTTP requests</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>When a request arrives, Twilio does a look up. Based on the timestamp they identify the API that was valid when this code was created and route accordingly.</p>

              <p>It's a very clever and interesting approach, although we think it is a bit complex. For example, it can be confusing to understand whether the timestamp is the compilation time or the timestamp when the API was released. </p>

          <section>
            <p>Salesforce.com uses v20.0, placed somewhere in the middle of the URL.</p>

            <p>We like the use of the v. notation. However, we don't like using the .0 because it implies that the interface might be changing more frequently than it should. The logic behind an interface can change rapidly but the interface itself shouldn't change frequently.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Facebook also uses the v. notation but makes the version an optional parameter.</p>

            <p>This is problematic because as soon as Facebook forced the API up to the next version, all the apps that didn't include the version number broke and had to be pulled back and version number added.</p>

            <p>Specify the version with a <strong>'v'</strong> prefix. Move it all the way to the left in the URL so that it has the highest scope <strong>(e.g. /v1/dogs)</strong>.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>Use a simple ordinal number. Don't use the dot notation like v1.2 because it implies a granularity of versioning that doesn't work well with APIs--it's an interface not an implementation. Stick with v1, v2, and so on.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>For how long should you maintain a version?</h3>

            <p>At least one cycle to react before obsoleting a version.</p>

            <p>Sometimes that's 6 months; sometimes it’s 2 years. It depends on developers' development platform, application type, and application users. For example, mobile apps take longer to rev’ than Web apps.</p>
